In such a situation, please contact us within 10 business days of receiving the item, and a return can be arranged. That being said, we strive to describe all items accurately. Residents of Maine must pay an additional 6.25% sales tax. We accept payment by Paypal, Zelle, and check, and we are happy to invoice upon request. With the exception of institutions, payment must be made prior to shipment. </p>
