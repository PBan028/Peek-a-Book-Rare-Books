		<p>Here is the digital archive for the catalogs of the Peek-a-Book Rare Books operation. This page gathers in one location all of the catalogs issued in the course of our business. A specialist in South Asian Americana, counterculture, and alternative religion, the Peek-a-Book operation proceeds by posting bi-weekly catalogs, making direct quotations, and maintains a growing presence on Instagram. 
		<br> We will do our best to ensure that the catalogs seen here accurately reflect the items'  availability therein, but please inquire about all items of interest, as we maintain a substantial backlog of uncataloged material, and some updates may inevitably slip our mind. We hope that even if none of our inventory enters your collection, our cataloging teaches you something you did not know before.</p>
  		<p>For the sake of clarity, we direct readers to this: <a href="https://www.abaa.org/glossary">ABAA Glossary of Terms</a> when curious about the technicalities of our descriptive language. We promise to do our utmost to describe the specifics of our items in as jargon-free language as possible, as well as to provide good-quality photographs of them as seen in the catalog. But, if there are still yet ambiguities, we encourage questioning</p>
